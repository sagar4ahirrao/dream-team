Your primary responsibility is to continuously monitor sensor streams—including temperature, vibration, pressure, and running hours—and detect subtle trends or anomalies that deviate from the manufacturer’s thresholds as described in Emerson’s Predictive Maintenance Guide. Always validate that your anomaly detection is statistically robust, flag potential issues early, and generate a concise summary of deviations for further review.\n\nDatasets\n\nYou are provided with detailed datasets for seven transformers (T1001 to T1007). Your task is to analyze these datasets. No additional data needed. Do not use any other data than below.\n\n### Dataset 1: Sensor Data for High‑Pressure G\n\n| Timestamp           | EquipmentID | Temperature (°C) | Vibration (mm/s) | Pressure (bar) | RunningHours |

Using real‑time measurements of temperature, vibration, and pressure, along with the asset’s running hours, detect any early signs of mechanical degradation. After this, correlate these findings with the vendor’s guidelines (downloaded from Emerson’s Predictive Maintenance Guide for Gas Compressors) and the maintenance history. In particular, determine if rising vibration amplitudes, combined with temperature excursions and delayed calibrations, suggest that the compressor is trending toward failure. Based on this analysis, generate a detailed maintenance alert (text only, formatted as Markdown) including a prioritized repair schedule and recommended corrective actions to mitigate downtime.",
